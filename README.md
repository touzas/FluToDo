# FluToDo
Yet another ToDo App

* A main branch contains a FluToDo application makes Android Native
* A master branch contains a FluToDo application makes with Xamarin Forms


This application will use a service in the cloud to work with the ToDo items through a Rest API.
The service is not live yet, but we have created a demo one that provides the same API as the
final one so we can start developing and testing the application before we launch it. The code is
stored in our github repo: https://github.com/fluendo/ToDoAPI
